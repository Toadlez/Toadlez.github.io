<p>hello!!</p>

<p>my name is toad (he/they). i'm a developer, and an artist!</p>

<p>i started out making games for the Playdate! you can find some of the games i've either made, or worked on, on the <a href="/arcade/">arcade</a> page!</a></p>

<p>more recently i've been getting into making art with Affinity Designer, and you can find my art over on the <a href="/gallery/">gallery</a> page!</p>

<p>maybe i'll start up a blog page on here some day, but personally i feel a bit weird writing about myself.</p>

<p>okay bye! have fun on the site ðŸ’š</p>
