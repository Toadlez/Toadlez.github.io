  date: 2025
  img: fletch-starting-soon.png
  img_alt:
    Digital artwork resembling paper. It's a stylized illustration of a town map, but animal/insect themed rather than human themed. The roads are shaped to look like a giant duck head!
    Notable locations include a pond, a grassy field, a pine forest, and a beach.
    Notable buildings include big colorful mushroom homes, a wizard tower, a treehouse, and a giant boot.
    All across the town are animals and insects!

    <p>Maybe there's even a component of fragility to it with the cracks n stuff? Like how, besides death, there are so many ways to lose contact with online friends. Your internet could go out, your computer could be destroyed, etc.</p>
